        <h3>TEN SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO HELP PROTECT THE EARTH</h3><hr>
      </header>
      <p>
        1. Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Cut down on what you throw away. <br>
        2. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural resources and landfill space.<br>
        3. Volunteer. Volunteer for cleanups in your community. You can get involved in protecting your watershed, too.<br>
        4. Educate. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the importance and value of our natural resources.<br>
        5. Conserve water. The less water you use, the less runoff and wastewater that eventually end up in the ocean.<br>
        6. Choose sustainable. Learn how to make smart seafood choices at www.fishwatch.gov.<br>
        7. Shop wisely. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable shopping bag.<br>
        8. Use long-lasting light bulbs. Energy efficient light bulbs reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also flip the light switch off when you leave the room!<br>
        9. Plant a tree. Trees provide food and oxygen. They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate change.<br>
        10. Don't send chemicals into our waterways. Choose non-toxic chemicals in the home and office.<br></p></div>
