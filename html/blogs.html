    <p class="para-air">Hazardous air pollutants are pollutants that are recognized or presumed to cause cancer and/or other other major health issues including birth defects and other reproductive effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) works with tribal, local, and state governments to help decrease the amount of toxics released into the environment. The EPA has recognized 187 pollutants as the most harmful to human and environmental health. Some examples of those pollutants are found in everyday products such as perchlorethlyene, which is typically emitted by non-green dry cleaning businesses, and benzene which is in gasoline.</p>

    <p class="para air2"> <b>Benzene</b>, in particular, is especially hazardous in the Pacific Northwest of the United States with the highest levels in the nation. This is due to higher than normal benzene content derived from Alaskan oils. Benzene is odorless and is a component of your gasoline. It is a dangerous pollutant and highly toxic in our air. People are generally exposed to vapors from benzene through breathing contaminated air or through skin exposure. The federal government knows this problem can lead to cancer and other sicknesses. Because children donâ€™t have fully developed immune systems, they are the most vulnerable to benzene fumes</p>
    
    <h3>Common ways people can be exposed to toxic air pollutants:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water can be contaminated by air pollutants, so drinking it will expose you.</li>
        <li>Vegetables and fruits that are grown in soil that is contaminated will expose you to pollutants if consumed</li>
        <li>Making skin contact with contaminated water (think water skiing), soil, or dust.
        </li>
        <li>Inhaling in polluted air (people breathe polluted air everyday).
        </li>
    </ul>
